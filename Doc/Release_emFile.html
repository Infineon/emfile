        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>FS_Unmount().
            FS_Unmount sets the state of a volume to uninitialized even if the volume is not mounted.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Program corrections</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Caches:
            When insufficient memory was assigned to the cache, the function could fail. Fixed.</li>
          <li>CacheRWQuota:
            When the FS_CACHE_SetMode and FS_CACHE_SetQuota was called after selecting the FS_CACHE_RWQUOTA cache all cached sector were wrongly invalided. Fixed.</li>
          <li>Alignment:
            When calling FS_GetFileAttributes with unaligned 32bit variable could cause on some CPU system a memory fault. Fixed.</li>
          <li>FAT:
            The character &quot;&amp;&quot; was identified as an invalid char when using it for a short name entry leading to fail the file/directory operation. Fixed</li>
          <li>LFN/UTF8:
            When copying a Unicode string the alignment of the buffer was not checked which could cause on some CPU system a memory fault. Fixed.</li>
          <li>LFN:
            When generating a short name entry for a long file name, an internal variable was incremented twice which lead to abort the short name generation in half of the time.</li>
          <li>OS locking
            When FS_OS_LOCKING is set 2, FS_X_OS_Lock() and FS_X_OS_Unlock() was called before FS_X_OS_Init() was called. Fixed.
            FS_DeInit:
            When using more than one volume, FS_DeInit will fail before of referencing a invalid pointer. Fixed.</li>
